# Message Importance Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a Message Importance Classifier using TF-IDF vectorization and the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. The goal is to classify messages into important or unimportant categories based on their content.

## Features
- 📊 **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to represent text data.
- 🧠 **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** Implements the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for message classification.
- 🏷️ **Importance Labeling:** Assigns messages into two categories: important or unimportant.

## Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📊 Scikit-learn library

## Getting Started
